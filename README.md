## Database Design

### Key Entities

#### Users
- `id` (PK)
- `username`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `created_at`

#### Properties
- `id` (PK)
- `owner_id` (FK to Users)
- `title`
- `description`
- `price_per_night`

#### Bookings
- `id` (PK)
- `user_id` (FK to Users)
- `property_id` (FK to Properties)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`

#### Reviews
- `id` (PK)
- `user_id` (FK to Users)
- `property_id` (FK to Properties)
- `rating`
- `comment`

#### Payments
- `id` (PK)
- `booking_id` (FK to Bookings)
- `amount`
- `status`
- `payment_date`

### Relationships

- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Booking** is linked to one **User** and one **Property**.
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property**.
- A **Payment** is associated with a single **Booking**.

---

## ðŸ”§ Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**  
  Handles registration, login, profile management, and user authentication.

- **Property Management**  
  Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings with detailed information.

- **Booking System**  
  Enables users to check availability and book properties for specific dates.

- **Review System**  
  Allows users to leave feedback and rate properties they've booked.

- **Payment Integration**  
  Simulates secure handling of payments linked to bookings.

## API Security

### Key Measures

- **Authentication**: Verifies user identity using token-based methods (e.g., JWT).
- **Authorization**: Ensures users only access resources theyâ€™re permitted to.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents misuse by restricting excessive requests.
- **Input Validation**: Mitigates attacks by sanitizing user inputs.
- **HTTPS & Secure Headers**: Encrypts communications and enforces secure browser policies.

> Security is essential to protect sensitive user data, secure payment details, and ensure trustworthiness of the application.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates code integration, testing, and deployment to reduce manual effort and human error.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Runs tests, builds, and deployment steps on each push or PR.
- **Docker**: Creates consistent environments for development, testing, and production.
- **(Optional)**: Hosting platforms like **Heroku**, **Render**, or **Vercel** for backend deployment.

> CI/CD boosts code reliability and team productivity by automating repetitive workflows.
